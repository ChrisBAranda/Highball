# Highball
My own repository with my own projects, whether it'd be from class or personal. Hoping to add more projects I've made on my own here.

Current projects finished:

-Internet Programming: 
  -Created a simple todo list that creates, edits, and deletes tasks.
  -Implemented simple login credentials for users to access the todo list.
  -Implemented Javascript to add in a live clock display on top of the list.
  
*More projects to be decided*
